My personal website and online resume.

As I explored the internet, I realized the importance of having a professional online presence. With this in mind, I decided to create my own online curriculum vitae, where I can showcase my skills, experiences, and achievements in an interactive and accessible way. I started this project on January 1, 2021, beginning with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the basic structure. Over time, I expanded my web development knowledge and included technologies like React.js and a statically generated version with Next.js.
