## Welcome

Hey folks, how's it going? , welcome to my small piece of the web.
 I'm Junior, hailing from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This is where I'll be sharing my developer journey, talking about web development, tech, books, movies, TV shows, and my latest passion, 3D printing.
Currently, I have a degree in Information Technology Management and I'm pursuing a postgrad in FullStack Development. Tech is my thing, and I'm always excited to learn something new.
I hope you enjoy the content and find it inspiring in some way.
