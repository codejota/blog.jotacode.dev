## Welcome

Hey folks, how's it going? , welcome to my small piece of the web.
 I'm Junior, hailing from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This is where I'll be sharing my developer journey, talking about web development, tech, books, movies, TV shows, and my latest passion, 3D printing.
Currently, I have a degree in Information Technology Management and I'm pursuing a postgrad in FullStack Development. Tech is my thing, and I'm always excited to learn something new.
I hope you enjoy the content and find it inspiring in some way.

  I'm no guru in anything, but I'm all in for learning and spreading what I pick up. I'm following the footsteps of Felipe Deschamps, one of my mentors, like him, I wanna help change people's lives through tech.</AlertDescription>

I see a lot of websites on the Internet. Blog, I want to create my own blog where I can write whatever I want. Regardless of the tutorial, notes, or journal.
 Therefore, I started learning web development skills in 2009. First, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
After a few years, I realized that a static website was not enough for me. So, I started learning React.js and then Next.js.
